Also, on the up note- I love being able to have my school with me 24 / 7!  I can send out group messages to my teammates and my professor.  I can also view my homework and grades.

However,  the main problem I have with it is that if you are not currently enrolled or have a future class scheduled the app will not allow you to log on to retrieve emails.  So one must log in using a Web browser which defeats the purpose of having the app.  If you have a current class the app is useful and easy to operate. '},

Having the reading materials on hand is convenient; however,  not being able to view the videos isn't.

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' Firstly having to  uninstall for every version release is silly, as opposed to updating the existing app. For use itself it is incredibly slow, navigation to the week's content is clunky and getting to sub comments is difficult. Purpose wise it really is only useful to check grades and announcements. What would be way more useful it to have actual content available such as text and videos for the course so they can be done away from the desktop. '},

Majority of what you need to get mobile access for class is right there.  Not sure why there are people confused on how to use the features on it.

It's alto nice and easy to complete DQs.  What I want to be added is the ability to download course materials in PDF format so that we can work on CheckPoints and other individual assignments while on the go. Nearly every smartphone has the ability to view PDFs now. And most have some sort of office program that lets you create .docx and .ppt files.  Also the UI is a little choppy. I think it uses too much RAM '},

There is a lot of reading to do to be successful at uop and being able to read on all platforms, especially an e reader is more important than anything else that needs to be included in this app. Everything else is not important...

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' Considering the amount I pay for tuition, and the fact your schools produce IT personnel, you would think your app would be up to date. Not only can I never log on, due to "Connection Error, not able to connect to the server", but it will get stuck on this screen and will not allow me to click out (so to say) and try again. Fix this, there is no reason why I should not be able to connect to your server at any point in time. '},

Only thing I find frustrating though is when you are trying to navigate through the threads... you have to go through all of them before you can see a new one.

One thing I would like to see for the Android version is a Widget feature where we can see my unread Discussion Posts on the main page of my tablet so I don't have to hunt for them in the app kind of like the facebook feed widget.

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' For a school that teaches programming, this is terrible. Very confusing on what are the main threads and what are replies. It should loom more like the website. I need to be able to access the reading material too. Plus, it is so slow. Its faster to go to the actual website. Just a sad display of an app. '},
{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' I like the idea of having an app to check posts from my instructors and review grades, but this app leaves much to be desired.  I used to get notifications on the original version, but since the last few updates, I get nothing.  My second issue is around the forums.  The current process to navigate through multiple posts on the same topic makes the app pointless.  It's beyond difficult to get to the most recent thread or read through the comments in a thread.  Honesty, this app is pointless unless I check it constantly for updates on grades.  I don't use it to interact with my team, I don't use it to read feedback on an assignment, I don't know if my instructor has responded to my posts...  Utterly useless! '},

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' I don't think that this application has worked properly more than 2 times in a row.  I am rather disappointed that a school that touts itself as being technologically advanced cannot create an application that works. I do see that a lot of folks seem to think it's great however. Maybe my particular installation is flawed. '},

I am glad that you can now download attachments, and view more than just the three forums.   The few things that I would like to see happen with this app though, would be: to allow the app to appear in landscape mode when viewing with a tablet that has a keyboard; To provide ways for uploading assignments in the same fashion as the website; and to make the spell checker work when making posts, and to have the posts appear the same way they do on the website. I have noticed when instructors post the syllabus, it does not format properly, and it is hard to read. The same can be said for weekly feedback that is posted.   If these improvements can be made, this app would be even better than it is now. '},

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' This app is great for phoenix students. Only problem ive noticed is that since the last update, it takes a while longer to load on samsung galaxy s2. This app could be improved if we were able to view/download materials on it and have an assignments tab like on the student website. Spell check would be great and i don't like the way the student replies are posted. I wish it would look more like the website for easier navigation. Latest update did improve app I'm some nice ways tho which is nice. '},
{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' This app was great until the recent update. Now it takes too long to load the discussion threads, doesn't show new comments in the threads and is inconsistent with notifications. Almost not worth using because of the slowness.

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' Prior to updating the application recently, I used it constantly on 2 different devices: RAZR MAXX on ICS and nexus 7 on jelly bean. After the update, the application has been acting poorly on both of my android devices. Razr Maxx takes considerably longer to open any posts then it took prior to update. Nexus 7 does not refresh the posts you clicked on most of the time after circling the circle for 30 -40 seconds, it comes up with no connection at the bottom of the screen rendering the device useless. Prior to contacting the support I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software on both devices with no luck. Support told me to do the same thing.  This application was great and allowed me to keep up with my classes from anywhere anytime, unfortunately now it only reminds of the song called Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell '},

A large majority of our homework and weekly participation is based on posts to the discussion board. It rarely glitches but sometimes does slide to the wrong posts. Minimizing and maximizing posts is not intuitive. One ability i wish they had was a real CHAT function not a chat forum. I would like to see a chat function like aim where you can control the parties involved in the discussion. My online team had a very difficult time communicating, this function would have been a huge help. '},

{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' 6 days after I installed the app it had racked up almost 300mb of data usage on my phone, and my battery life became about 25% less. My phone used to get to 20% battery by 11pm (since removing off charger at 8am). Today it was at 4% by 7pm. Needless to say I've removed both this app and Bookshelf, another useless app. The phoenix app doesn't show much useful info. Yes, you can see some comments and respond to some, but overall, nothing that would significantly bring value over what you can do on your laptop in terms of convenience and time-saving, and the data/battery drain make it even less worthwhile. Don't waste your time. '},
{ 'appName':'University of Phoenix Mobile', 'appScore':'4.2',' comment':' But it is unusable in a lot of places and you are better off just going to the website on your phone which is sad.

A box always pops up saying I have to force stop it.  The worse thing is that I can't access the reading.  If I had the reading then I wouldn't need this app. So basically I use it just to read other's post or my feedback.  Please allow us to access more, like the reading.  Thanks. '},

This upgrade should be for phones as well as tablets. It won't take many lines of code either. We can email from the board but remember that  "Technology Changes Everything".
